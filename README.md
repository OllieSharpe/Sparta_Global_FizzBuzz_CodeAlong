# Sparta_Global_FizzBuzz_CodeAlong

Project contains multiple small tasks from the project Euler site: https://projecteuler.net.

The repo is constructed using the principles of object oriented programming and each method is tested using RSpec.

this repo also contains a class 'FizzBuzz' which should be separated into testable methods which will be tested via RSpec.

### Three and Five
Added a new class to the repo which summates the multiples of 3 and 5 up to 1000, also tested with rspec

### Even fibonacci
Added a new class to the repo which summates all the even values in the fibonacci sequence, also tested in rspec.

### Largest Prime multiple
Added an new class to the repo which searches for the largest prime number multiple of any given number.
